- title: Common
  checklist: 
    - Base duration > 4 weeks
    - Price > 150MA
    - RS at/near 52 wk high
    - Volume smaller on contractions
    - Volume < 30 MA before breakout
    - Volume > 2x 30 MA on breakout
    - Volume > 3-5x of day before breakout

- title: Bonus
  checklist: 
  - Shake-out demand tail
  - Gap-down reversal bar
  notes: Better if they undercut a key moving average. Gap-down reversal bar is generally a better indication of high demand, since demand immediately steps in, as price falls. A demand tail or a reversal bar with low volume indicate less supply. High volume indicates more supply, so maybe the base needs some more time to develop. Large gap-down reversal bar with low volume shows ease of movement.
